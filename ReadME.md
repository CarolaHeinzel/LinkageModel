# LinkageModel

This repository contains the following python files. <br>

: Code to calculate the MLE for the ancestry in the Linkage Model for arbitrary many chromosomes by using the EM Algorithm. <br>
: Code to evaluate the code to find the MLE in the Linkage Model.<br>
: Code to compare the  Fischer Information to the bootstrap variance. <br>
: Code to calculate the Fischer Information for both, the linkage model and the admixture model.<br>
: Code to apply the statistical test with H0: The user should apply the Admixture Model vs. H1: The user should use the Linkage Model to real data.<br>
: Code to evaluate the statistical test.<br>
: Code to plot the results.<br>

Moreover, it contains <br>

: example data, which have the correct format for the statistical test.<br>

## Application of the code

To apply the code, please download the files and run them in e.g. spyder. <br>

## Example Output of the code
