# LinkageModel

This repository contains the following python files.

: Code to calculate the MLE for the ancestry in the Linkage Model for arbitrary many chromosomes by using the EM Algorithm.
: Code to evaluate the code to find the MLE in the Linkage Model.
: Code to calculate the Fischer Information for both, the linkage model and the admixture model.
: Code to apply the statistical test with H0: The user should apply the Admixture Model vs. H1: The user should use the Linkage Model to real data.
: Code to evaluate the statistical test.
: Code to plot the results.

Moreover, it contains 

: example data, which have the correct format for the statistical test.

## Application of the code

To apply the code, please download the files and run them in e.g. spyder.
