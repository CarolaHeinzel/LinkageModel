There are four different files to evaluate the statistical test for diploid individuals. Theres files are:

Evaluation_test_diploid.py: Main file, combines the functions from the other files to one statistical test. <br>
Simulation_Linkage_diploid.py: Simulates gengetic data according to the linkage model, for which we assume that the data is phased. <br>
Test_LM_AM_diploid.py: Calcualtes the likelihood for both the Admixture Model and the Linkage Model. This file also calculates the test statistic, the critical value and the p-value for one samples. <br>
Grid_Search_Linkage_diploid.py: Calculates the MLE for the Linkage Model. <br>
